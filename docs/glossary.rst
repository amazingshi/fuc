Tumor mutational burden (TMB)
=============================

Number of genetic alternations detected within an individual.

Transitions (Ti) and transversions (Tv)
=======================================

DNA substitution mutations are of two types. Transitions are interchanges of two-ring purines (A ↔ G) or of one-ring pyrimidines (C ↔ T): they therefore involve bases of similar shape. Transversions are interchanges of purine for pyrimidine bases, which therefore involve exchange of one-ring and two-ring structures.
